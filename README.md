# group-project1

Discription:
Created a local brewery locator application that allows the user to search for any city and retrieve the forcasted temerature, for the location as well as a list of all Breweries in the area.


</br>


boiler plate added<br>
variables created in javascript<br>
added script source in html for javascript<br>
created flexbox for campsites<br>
added api from yelp in js<br>
added api and key for weather forcast<br>

The apps base build was to approach the look-n-feel from a mobile perspective. Adding the flexbox elements to address any spillage… giving the ui a very easy to follow aesthetic. <br>

We then moved on to extracting the correct information from both api’s to assure we were displaying the basic information needed for the search. <br>


We expanded on that and then made the brewery site link urls active so the user would be brought to the appropriate brewery webpage. Additionally we ensured that the phone numbers were ‘click to call’.<br>


Added Local Storage to store users previous searches. We opted not to have the users previous searches persist on page refresh feeling it would cause unnecessary clutter and hassle to constantly  clear their search history. <br>


Lastly, to advocate for a safe night out we felt it to be appropriate to have a Uber button to direct users to the Uber homepage. For future development <br>
